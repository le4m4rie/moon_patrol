# Moon Patrol 

This is a Moon Patrol game developed as part of my Java programming course.
The game is a simple implementation of the classic Moon Patrol arcade game,
where players control a lunar rover and navigate through challenging terrain while avoiding obstacles and enemy attacks.
Developing this game was a lot of fun and also was a good exercise to dive deeper into object oriented programming!
